# Unhappy Path Audit Skill

## Core Logic (First Principles)

**Unhappy path auditing = answering three propositions:**

| Q | Proposition | Violation Consequence |
|---|-------------|----------------------|
| **Q1: Every creation has a destruction** | For every resource creation path → a corresponding destruction path, and destruction is guaranteed to reach | **Leak** |
| **Q2: Every wait event has a termination** | For every potentially blocking synchronization point → there exists a release event that is guaranteed to occur | **Hung** |
| **Q3: Every accumulation has an upper bound** | For every unbounded-growth container → capacity limit or recycling mechanism | **OOM** |

**Key principle**: Not "looks like it might leak/hang", but "prove it definitely leaks/hangs". Q2 requires **proving the wait does not terminate**, not "looks like it's missing a timeout" — exhaust all bypass paths before ruling.

---

## Systematic Method (Drill-Down Algorithm)

```
Entry function
  └→ Layer 1: Execute Q1-Q3 on every resource/wait/accumulation point
      ├─ Termination condition satisfied at this layer → ✅, stop drill-down
      └─ Termination condition depends on a lower layer → ⬇ drill down to Layer 2
          └→ Recurse with Q1-Q3
```

### Drill-Down Example

```
proxy.Close()
  └→ tunnel.Close()                 ← Q1: Destruction guaranteed? ✅ (defer)
      └→ pipe.kickoff() exit        ← Q2: io.EOF guaranteed? → depends on connection.Close()
          └→ connection.Close()     ← Q2: Close guaranteed? → depends on morpc readLoop detection
              └→ morpc readLoop     ← Q2: Condition for detecting close?
                  ├─ readTimeout > 0 → periodic return + detect → ✅
                  └─ readTimeout = 0 → forever blocked on conn.Read → ❌ Bug
```

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1 — Scope Definition

```
Input: target module list
Actions:
  1. Trace the complete call chain from entry to exit
  2. Number layers: Layer 1, Layer 2, ... Layer N
  3. Mark each layer's concern dimensions (goroutine/connection/lock/memory/...)
Output: audit scope matrix
```

### Phase 2 — Per-Layer Audit

```
For each Layer:
  1. read_file ≤ 6 files (hard limit)
  2. Execute Q1-Q3 three questions on this layer
  3. Record verdict + layer number where termination condition is satisfied
  4. If termination depends on a lower layer → mark drill-down target, do not conclude at this layer
  5. Output this layer's audit table → then proceed to the next layer
```

**Anti-false-positive rule**: For every wait point, first exhaust all release paths (including defer, cancel watcher, timer goroutine). Only rule it hung when every path is confirmed unreachable.

### Phase 3 — Synthesis

```
1. Merge all layer audit tables
2. Extract failed Q1/Q2/Q3 items
3. Verify termination chain integrity (no break from entry to exit)
4. Apply Bug Claim Verification Checklist (see Critical Rules) to each candidate
5. Generate Issue templates for confirmed Bugs
Output: final risk matrix + Bug list
```

## Output Format

### Per-Layer Audit Table (Phase 2 output)

```
Layer N: [Module Name] ([File Name])

| Q | Proposition | Code Path | Verdict | Termination Layer |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Q1 | creation→destruction | go xxx() → defer close() | ✅ | Layer N |
| Q2 | wait→termination | cond.Wait() → Broadcast | ✅ | Layer N (cancel watcher) |
| Q3 | accumulation→bound | channel | ✅ | Layer N |
```

### Final Risk Matrix (Phase 3 output)

```
| # | Bug | Layer | Q | Severity | Issue |
|---|-----|-------|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | [description] | Layer X | Q2 | High | #12345 |
```

### Termination Chain Verification (Phase 3 output)

```
Entry
  └→ Layer 1: destruction call ✅
      └→ Layer 2: wait released ✅
          └→ Layer 3: **BREAK** ← Q1 destruction unreachable
```

## Critical Rules

### Core Rules

1. **Anti-confirmation-bias**: prove "definitely leaks/hangs", not "looks like it might" — exhaust all bypass paths before ruling
2. **Batch hard limit**: ≤ 6 read_file per batch, must output audit conclusion for that batch before continuing
3. **Exit self-check**: before ending the turn confirm — ①conclusion in first paragraph ②audit table present ③Bug has Issue
4. **Drill-down discipline**: when termination condition is not satisfied, mark "pending drill-down", do not speculate at the current layer

### Bug Claim Verification Checklist (BEFORE filing ANY bug)

**Every bug claim MUST pass all 5 gates before being included in the final report:**

| # | Gate | Verification Action | Anti-Pattern (caught by spill audit) |
|---|------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **G1** | **FULL-GRAPH** | Resource ownership traced to ALL terminal nodes — do not stop at the next hop | Bug: traced `spillFiles → JoinMap` but stopped; missed `JoinMap.Destroy()` → `FreeMemory()` → fd close |
| **G2** | **CAN-FAIL** | Open the alleged failure function body; confirm it CAN actually panic/error/block. If it's nil-check+assign, it cannot fail | Bug: assumed `handOffFd()` could panic; function body is only `nil check + Seek + = nil` |
| **G3** | **SYMMETRY** | For every growth claim (append/push/alloc), grep the variable name + `= nil` / `= make` / truncate; confirm NO reset point exists anywhere in the lifecycle | Bug: saw `spillIndex = append(...)`, missed `spillIndex = nil` in `cleanupSpill()` |
| **G4** | **LINE-REREAD** | Re-read every cited line number AFTER forming the bug hypothesis — do not trust memory from the initial read | Bug: asserted `ctr.state` doesn't become `SendSucceed` on failure; line 127 shows it's unconditional |
| **G5** | **CALIBRATE-LAST** | Severity (Low/Medium/High) assigned ONLY after G1-G4 pass AND all bugs in the batch are confirmed. Never assign severity during discovery | Bug was Medium → turned out to be false positive (severity meaningless) |

**Process rule**: G1-G4 are per-bug gates applied during Phase 2→3 transition. G5 is a global gate applied after the full bug list is finalized. Any bug failing G1-G4 is **discarded**, not downgraded.

### G1 Detail: Full-Graph Traversal

For every resource (fd, lock, goroutine, memory allocation), construct the complete directed graph:

```
Creation Point ──transfer──→ Holder A ──transfer──→ Holder B ──transfer──→ ...
                                  │                    │
                                  ▼                    ▼
                              Reset()              Destroy()
                              Free()               FreeMemory()
```

Required actions per node:
1. Identify every transfer function (hand-off, assignment, message send)
2. For each transfer target, locate its destruction path
3. Verify destruction path is reachable on error branches too
4. Repeat until reaching a node with NO further transfer (terminal)

**Stop condition**: Graph is complete when every leaf is either (a) a verified destructor call, or (b) a GC-managed resource with bounded lifetime.

### G3 Detail: Symmetry Check

For any variable `V` that exhibits growth (`append`, `map[K]=V`, channel send, allocation):

1. Find all assignments to `V` (grep `V\s*=`)
2. Confirm one of these assigns nil / empty / zero
3. Verify that assignment is ALWAYS reached before the variable goes out of scope

Common false positive: variable is reset in a function you haven't read yet (e.g., `Reset()`, `Free()`, `cleanup()`). Always search for these BEFORE filing a Q3 bug.

## Appendix C: Common False Positive Patterns

| False Positive Pattern | Correct Adjudication Path | Gate Violated |
|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| See `cond.Wait()` without timeout → report hung | Exhaust all `Broadcast()` call sites (including defer, cancel watcher, timer goroutine) | — |
| See goroutine launched without explicit stop → report leak | Check goroutine-internal exit paths: `ctx.Done()` / `io.EOF` / channel close | — |
| See `sync.Map.Store` without delete → report OOM | Check TTL / active GC cleanup / refcount→0 cleanup | — |
| See `close()` without sending RPC → report resource leak | Check if remote has TTL self-cleanup / bind change detection | — |
| See RPC wait without timeout → report hung | Trace upward context for deadline, check if caller guarantees cancel | — |
| See channel send potentially blocking → report hung | Verify non-blocking (select + default), or guarantee receiver always consumes | — |
| See resource transferred to next holder, close not found in current scope → report leak | Trace ownership to ALL terminal nodes — next holder may have Destroy()/FreeMemory() | G1 |
| See append/push without bound in current scope → report OOM | Grep variable + `= nil` — cleanup function in sibling file may reset it | G3 |
| See function call that "might" panic → report fd leak on panic path | Open function body — nil-check+assign or simple arithmetic cannot panic | G2 |
| See `SendMessage` return error → assume upstream state machine doesn't clean up | Re-read the exact line where state is set — it may be unconditional | G4 |
