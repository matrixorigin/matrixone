#
#    2. set up the prophet genesis node
#        2.1. make sure the nodeID is unique
#        2.2. change the addr-raft ip to the machine ip
#        2.3. change the addr-client ip to the machine ip
#        2.4. make sure the prophet name is different from the names of other two prophet node

#        2.7. change the peer-urls ip to the machine ip
#        2.8. change the shard-groups value to 2
#        2.9. make sure the dir-data is different from the other nodes in the cluster
#
#    3. set up the other two prophet nodes
#        3.1. apply the above 9 steps of prophet genesis node setting
#        3.2. change the prophet join address from empty string to the prophet genesis node's peer-urls
#   
#    4. set up pure storage node
#        4.1. make sure the nodeID is unique
#        4.2. change storage-node to false
#        4.3. change the addr-raft ip to the machine ip
#        4.4. change the addr-client ip to the machine ip
#        4.5. In the external-etcd attribute, fill the three empty string with the three peer-urls of the three prophet node
#        4.6. make sure the dir-data is different from the other nodes in the cluster
#        4.7. change the shard-groups value to 2
