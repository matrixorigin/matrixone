# This file configures wheels compilation for `cibuilwheel` for USearch CPython bindings.
# On a good day it will produce:
#   - `macos` wheels for x86_64, arm64, and universal2;
#   - `windows` wheels for AMD64, and ARM64. But not x86.
#   - `manylinux` and `musllinux` wheels for Linux on x86_64, aarch64. But not i686, ppc64le, s390x;
#   * for CPython versions from 3.7 to 3.13.
#   * for PyPy versions from 3.7 to 3.10.
#   = meaning 7 platforms * 11 Python versions = 77 builds.
