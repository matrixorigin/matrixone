        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this feature request!
        We have already scheduled a few features for our [next milestone](https://github.com/unum-cloud/usearch/milestones).
        Still, if it is something we have yet to think about, we will happily extend our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/unum-cloud/projects/2).
        It is also worth noting that choosing between speed and functionality, we generally prefer the former.
        So in some cases, it makes more sense to build something on top of USearch rather than patch it ðŸ¤—
