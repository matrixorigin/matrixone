# **MatrixOne v0.5.1 Release Notes**

We are excited to announce MatrixOne 0.5.1 release on 2022/8/19. In this release, MatrixOne resolved some log replaying and storage Garbage Collection(GC) issues.

## Docker

```
docker pull matrixorigin/matrixone:0.5.1
```

## Function Optimize

- Optimize checkpoint in replay. #4214
- Fix the bug that block and index file reference count is not released. #4052
- Fix the bug that replay dead loop when the log is not full. #4051

These bugs lead to some stability issues of a MatrixOne instance.
