# **NYC Test Performance**

## **Overview**

With MatrixOne v0.2.0, we follow the [Tutorial](../Get-Started/Tutorial/NYC-test-with-matrixone.md) to execute **NYC Taxi** test with a standalone server, and compare the results with that of other products, which shows the performance of MatrixOne in query processing time.
