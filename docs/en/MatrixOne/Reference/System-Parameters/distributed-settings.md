For a distributed setting, the following parameters should be paied attention to. 

### Configuration Settings

To configurate a distributed setting, following parameters need to be modified in the default Configuration file 'system_vars_config.toml'.

* **nodeID**

    `nodeID` is the Node ID of the cube. In a cluster, each node should have a different `nodeID`.

* **addr-raft and addr-advertise-raft**

    `addr-raft` is the address for raft-group rpc communication. 

    It is the 10000 port of the node.

    ```
    addr-raft = "localhost:10000"
    ```

    Only docker deployment need adjust `addr-advertise-raft`

    For docker deployment, the ip is `0.0.0.0`

    ```
    addr-raft = "0.0.0.0:10000"
    ```

    In the case that some clients cannot access the raft-group, `addr-advertise-raft` must be manually set.

    ```
    addr-advertise-raft = "${HOST}:10000"
    ```

* **addr-client and addr-advertise-client**

    `addr-client` is the address for cube service.
    It is the 20000 port of the node.

    ```
    addr-client = "localhost:20000"  
    ```

    Only docker deployment need adjust `addr-advertise-client`

    For docker deployment, the ip is `0.0.0.0`

    ```
    addr-client = "0.0.0.0:20000"  
    ```

    In the case that a client cannot access Cube through the default client URLs listened to by Cube, `addr-advertise-client` must be manually set.

    ```
    addr-advertise-client = "${HOST}:20000"
    ```

* **dir-data**

    `dir-data` is the directory for cube data. In a cluster, each node should have a different `dir-data`.

* **store-heartbeat-duration**

    `store-heartbeat-duration` is the period for this node to report information to scheduler. It should be less than 10s.

* **prophet name**

    `name` in `Prophet Configs` is the name of the node. In a cluster, each node should have a different prophet name.

    ```
    name = "node0"
    ```

* **rpc-addr and rpc-advertise-addr**

    `rpc-addr` is the address for other clients to access prophet. 
    It is the 30000 port of the node.

    ```
    rpc-addr = "localhost:30000"
    ```

    Only docker deployment need adjust `rpc-advertise-addr`

    For docker deployment, the ip is `0.0.0.0`

    ```
    rpc-addr = "0.0.0.0:30000"  
    ```

    In the case that a client cannot access prophet, `rpc-advertise-addr` must be manually set.

    ```
    rpc-advertise-addr = "${HOST}:30000"
    ```

* **prophet-node**

    `prophet-node` is whether the node is a pure prophet node.
    For the three prophet nodes, `prophet-node` is `true`.

    ```
    prophet-node = true
    ```

    For pure prophet nodes, `prophet-node` is `false`

    ```
    prophet-node = false
    ```

* **external-etcd**

    For the three prophet nodes, `external-etcd` is empty.

    ```
    external-etcd = ["", "", ""]
    ```

    For pure storage nodes, `external-etcd` is the list of the `client-urls` of the three prophet nodes, i.e. the 40000 port of the prophet nodes.

    ```
    external-etcd = ["http://ip_of_prophet_node1:40000", "http://ip_of_prophet_node2:40000", "http://ip_of_prophet_node3:40000"]
    ```

* **join**

    `join` is for the second and third prophet nodes to join the raft group.
    For the first prophet node, `join` is a empty string.

    ```
    join = ""
    ```

    For the second and third prophet node, `join` is the `peer-urls` of the first prophet node.

    ```
    join = "http://ip_of_the_first_prophet_node:40000"
    ```

    For pure storage nodes, there's no need to adjust `join`.

* **client-urls and advertise-client-urls**

    `client-urls` is exposed to other nodes in the cluster.
    It is 40000 port of the node

    ```
    client-urls = "http://localhost:40000"
    ``` 

    Only docker deployment need adjust `advertise-client-urls`

    For docker deployment, the ip is `0.0.0.0`

    ```
    client-urls = "http://0.0.0.0:40000"
    ```

    In the case that some clients ccannot access prophet through the default client URLs listened to by prophet, `advertise-client-urls` must be manually set.

    ```
    advertise-client-urls = "http://${HOST}:40000
    ```

* **peer-urls and advertise-peer-urls**

    `peer-urls` is the list of peer URLs to be listened to by a prophet node. It is the 40000 port of the node.

    ```
    peer-urls = "http://localhost:50000"
    ```

    Only docker deployment need adjust `advertise-peer-urls`

    For docker deployment, the ip is `0.0.0.0`

    ```
    peer-urls = "http://0.0.0.0:50000"
    ```

    In the case that a node cannot be listened to by a prophet node, `advertise-peer-urls` should be manually set.

    ```
    advertise-peer-urls = "http://${HOST}:50000"
    ```

* **max-replicas**

    `max-replicas` is the max number of replica in a prophet group. It should be 3.
    
    ```
    max-replicas = 3
    ```
