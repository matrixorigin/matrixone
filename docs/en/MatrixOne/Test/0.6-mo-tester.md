From the 0.5.0 version, MatrixOne introduces an automatic testing framework [MO-Tester](https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester).

This tester is designed to test MatrixOne or other database functionalities with SQL.

# What's in MO-Tester?

MO-Tester is a java-based tester suite for MatrixOne. It has built a whole toolchain to run automatic SQL tests. It contains the test cases and results. Once launched, MO-Tester runs all SQL test cases with MatrixOne, and compares all output SQL results with expected results. All successful and failed cases will be logged into reports.

MO-Tester content locations:

* *Cases*: <https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test/cases>

* *Result*: <https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester/tree/main/result>

    + *Result* can also generated in the path of [/cases](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test/cases/), for example, [/cases/auto_increment](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test/cases/auto_increment).

* *Report*: once finished running, a `mo-tester/report` will be generated in the local directory.

The Cases and Results are 1-1 correspondence, and they are actually `git submodules` from MatrixOne repository. Adding new cases and results should be in MatrixOne repo: <https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/tree/main/test>
<!--这个submodules我好像还没设置-sudong-->

# How to use MO-Tester?

## 1. Prepare the testing environment

* Make sure you have installed jdk8.

* Launch MatrixOne or other database instance. Please refer to more information about [how to install and launch MatrixOne](../Get-Started/install-standalone-matrixone/).

* Clone *mo-tester* repository.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/mo-tester.git
  ```

* Clone *matrixOne* repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git
   ```

## 2. Configure `mo-tester`

* In `mo.yml` file, configure the server address, default database name, username, and password, etc. MO-tester is based on java, so these parameters are required for the JDBC(JDBC，Java Database Connectivity) driver. Below is a default example for a local standalone version MatrixOne.

  ```
  #jdbc
  jdbc:
    driver: "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
    server:
    - addr: "127.0.0.1:6001"
    database:
      default: "test"
    paremeter:
      characterSetResults: "utf8"
      continueBatchOnError: "false"
      useServerPrepStmts: "true"
      alwaysSendSetIsolation: "false"
      useLocalSessionState: "true"
      zeroDateTimeBehavior: "CONVERT_TO_NULL"
      failoverReadOnly: "false"
      serverTimezone: "Asia/Shanghai"
      socketTimeout: 30000
  #users
  user:
    name: "dump"
    passwrod: "111"
  ```

## 3. Run mo-tester

* With the simple below command, all the SQL test cases will automatically run and generate reports and error messages to *report/report.txt* and *report/error.txt*.

```
> ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases
```

If you'd like to adjust the test range, you can just change the `path` parameter of `run.yml`. And you can also specify some parameters when executing the command `./run.sh`, parameters are as followings:

|Parameters|Description|
|---|---|
|-p|set the path of test cases needed to be executed by mo-tester, the default value is configured by the `path` in `run.yaml`|
|-m|set the method that mo-tester will run with, the default value is configured by the `method` in `run.yaml`|
|-t| set the type of the format that mo-tester executes the SQL command in, the default value is configured by the `type` in `run.yaml`|
|-r|set The success rate that test cases should reach, the default value is configured by the `rate` in `run.yaml`|
|-i|set the including list, and only script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will be executed, if more than one, separated by `,`, if not specified, refers to all cases included|
|-e|set the excluding list, and script files in the path whose name contains one of the lists will not be executed, if more than one, separated by `,`, if not specified, refers to none of the cases excluded|
|-g|means SQL commands which is marked with [bvt:issue] flag will not be executed,this flag starts with [-- @bvt:issue#{issueNO.}],and ends with [-- @bvt:issue],eg:<br>-- @bvt:issue#3236<br/><br>select date_add("1997-12-31 23:59:59",INTERVAL "-10000:1" HOUR_MINUTE);<br/><br>select date_add("1997-12-31 23:59:59",INTERVAL "-100 1" YEAR_MONTH);<br/><br>-- @bvt:issue<br/><br>Those two sql commands are associated with issue#3236, and they will not be executed in bvt test, until the flag is removed when issue#3236 is fixed.<br/>|
|-n|means the metadata of the resultset will be ignored when comparing the result|
|-c|only check whether the case file matches the related result file|

**Examples**:

```
./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases -m run -t script -r 100 -i select,subquery -e substring -g
```

If you want to automatically generate SQL results for the new SQL cases, you can just change the `method` parameter of *run.yml* file to `genrs`, or you can just change the command `-m run` to `-m genrs`, then running the `./run.sh` scripts will directly record test results in the same path of the new SQL case file. For more information on example, see <a href="#new_test_scenario">Example 4</a>.

!!! note
    Every time running `run.sh` will overwrite the report of the  *error.txt* file, *report.txt* file, and *success.txt* file in the  *mo-tester* repository.

## 4. Check the report

* Once the test is finished, *mo-tester* generates *error.txt* file, *report.txt* file and *success.txt* file reports.

* An example of *report.txt* file looks like this:

```
[SUMMARY] COST : 98s, TOTAL :12702, SUCCESS : 11851, FAILED :13, IGNORED :838, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 99%
[{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/auto_increment/auto_increment_columns.sql] COST : 2.159s, TOTAL :185, SUCCESS :163, FAILED :0, IGNORED :22, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100%
[{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/benchmark/tpch/01_DDL/01_create_table.sql] COST : 0.226s, TOTAL :11, SUCCESS :11, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100%
[{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/benchmark/tpch/02_LOAD/02_insert_customer.sql] COST : 0.357s, TOTAL :16, SUCCESS :16, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100%
```

|Report Keywords|Description|
|---|---|
|TOTAL|the total number of executed test cases (SQL)|
|SUCCESS|The total number of successfully executed test cases(SQL)|
|FAILED|the total number of failed executed test case(SQL)|
|IGNORED| the total number of ignored executed test cases (SQL), especially with the `--bvt:issue` tag test cases (SQL)|
|ABNORAML|the total number of abnormal executed test cases (SQL), such as the execution of MatrixOne can't determine the actual result is a system exception or *.result* file parsing error, etc|
|SUCCESS RATE|success rate: SUCCESS/(TOTAL - IGNORED)|

* An example of *error.txt* file looks like this:

```
[ERROR]
[SCRIPT   FILE]: cases/transaction/atomicity.sql
[ROW    NUMBER]: 14
[SQL STATEMENT]: select * from test_11 ;
[EXPECT RESULT]:
c	d
1	1
2 2
[ACTUAL RESULT]:
c	d
1	1
```

### <h3><a name="new_test_scenario">Example 4</a></h3>

**Example Description**:

- Create a new folder named *local_test* and place it in *{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases*
- Add a test file named *new_test.sql* to *{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/local_test/*
- Only run the single test case *new_test.sql**

**Steps**

1. Get the latest *matrixone* code.

   ```
   cd matrixone
   git pull https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git
   ```

2. Generate test results:

   - Method 1: To generate the test result, you need switch into the  *mo-tester* repository first, then, run the following command.

      ```
      cd mo-tester
      ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/local_test/new_test.sql -m genrs -g
      ```

   - Method 2: Open the *run.yml* file in the *mo-tester* repository, change the *method* parameter from the default `run` to `genrs`, and run the following command to generate the test result.

      ```
      cd mo-tester
      ./run.sh -p {path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/local_test/new_test.sql
      ```

3. Check the result file in the *test/cases、result/* path of the *matrixone* repository.

4. Check the result reports in the *error.txt* file, *report.txt* file, and *success.txt* file in the *mo-tester/report/* path. The example of the expected *report.txt* looks like this:

   ```
   [SUMMARY] COST : 0s, TOTAL :66, SUCCESS : 66, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100%
   [{path_name}/matrixone/test/cases/transaction/atomicity.sql] COST : 0.56s, TOTAL :66, SUCCESS :66, FAILED :0, IGNORED :0, ABNORAML :0, SUCCESS RATE : 100%
   ```
