# **Playground**

[MatrixOne Playground](https://playground.matrixorigin.io/?tutorial=SSB-test-with-matrixone&step=1) allows you to try SQL statements and explore features of MatrixOne instantly from your web browser with interactive tutorials.  

* For docs about our SQL commands, you can see [SQL Reference](../Reference/SQL-Reference/Data-Definition-Statements/create-database.md).  
* For tutorials about **SSB** test, you can see [Tutorial](../Get-Started/Tutorial/SSB-test-with-matrixone.md).

## **Limitations**

You can only operate in **read-only** mode in MatixOrigin Playground，so DDL commands and part of DML commands which may change the data are not available. The detail limitations are shown below:

* **DDL** commands are not available:  
`create/drop table` , `truncate` , `update` , `set` , `use`  

* Part of **DML** commands are not available：  
`insert` , `replace` , `delete`,`select into`  

* `commit` is not available

* `call` is not available

* **max_result_rows**=2000  

## **Examples**

In Playground, You can follow different interactive tutorials and pick one in the list box, and now the supported tutorials are shown below:  

* [**SSB Test with MatrixOne**](https://playground.matrixorigin.io/?tutorial=SSB-test-with-matrixone&step=1)

We will use **SSB Test** as an example to show you the overall operation process of Playground.  

### **Test Preperations**  

This tutorial walks you through the most popular **Star Schema Benchmark（SSB）**Test SQL statements with MatrixOne. To better experience MatrixOne's features and performance, test queries in this tutorial will run without filters.  
Before you start, the test datasets have been pre-loaded in  database `ssb`. To list available tables in the database you can query :

```
SHOW TABLES；
```

!!! note  "<font size=4>Tips</font>"
    <font size=3>You can click on the command to copy and **Run** it in the terminal on the right.</font>  
    <font size=3>The query results are displayed in the lower right.</font>  
    <font size=3>Then you can run the queries on SSB datasets, click **Continue**.</font>  

### **Run Query Command**

Now, You can query the table with SQL commands we provide.  
For example:  

* **Run Q1.1 query**

```
select sum(lo_revenue) as revenue
from lineorder join dates on lo_orderdate = d_datekey；
```

And you can use ```join``` in queries:

* **Run Q1.2 query**

```
select sum(lo_revenue) as revenue
from lineorder
join dates on lo_orderdate = d_datekey；
```

Additionally, ```group by``` and ```order by``` can be used:

* **Run Q2.1 query**

```
select sum(lo_revenue) as lo_revenue, d_year, p_brand
from lineorder
join dates on lo_orderdate = d_datekey
join part on lo_partkey = p_partkey
join supplier on lo_suppkey = s_suppkey
group by d_year, p_brand
order by d_year, p_brand;
```

More query commands are provided in **Playground**, you can test on your own.
