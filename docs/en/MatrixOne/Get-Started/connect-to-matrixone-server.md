# **Connect to MatrixOne Server**

## **Before you start**

Make sure you have already [installed MatrixOne](install-standalone-matrixone.md).

## **1. Install MySQL client**

MatrixOne supports the MySQL wire protocol, so you can use MySQL client drivers to connect from various languages. For more information on connecting to MatrixOne through a MySQL client, see[Connect to the MatrixOne server through a client](../Develop/connect-mo/client-connect-to-matrixone.md).

Currently, MatrixOne is only compatible with the Oracle MySQL client. This means that some features might not work with the MariaDB client or Percona client.

## **2. Connect to MatrixOne server**

You can use the MySQL command-line client to connect to MatrixOne server:

```
mysql -h IP -P PORT -uUsername -p
```

The connection string is the same format as MySQL accepts. You need to provide a user name and a password.

Use the built-in test account for example:

- user: dump
- password: 111

```
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 6001 -udump -p
Enter password:
```

Currently, MatrixOne only supports the TCP listener.

For more information on connecting to MatriOne, see
[Using client connect to the MatrixOne server](../Develop/connect-mo/client-connect-to-matrixone.md) and [Using programming connect to the MatrixOne server](../Develop/connect-mo/programming-connect-to-matrixone.md).
