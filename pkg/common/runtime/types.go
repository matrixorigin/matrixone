// Runtime contains the runtime environment for a MO service. Each CN/DN/LOG service
// needs to receive a Runtime and will pass the Runtime to all components of the service.
// These Runtimes may only be created in main or integration test framework.
//
// Because most of our BVT tests and integration tests are run in a single mo-service
// process, which runs multiple CN, TN and LOG services, the Runtime cannot be set as a
// global variable, otherwise we would not be able to set a single Runtime for each service
// and each component.
//
// In other words, there are no global variables inside mo-service, and the scope of global
// variables is in a Runtime.
//
// Since each component holds a Runtime, all mo-service-level parameters should not appear in
// the parameter list of the component's initialization function, but should be replaced by the
// Runtime's global variables.
//
// Unfortunately, we can't fully support the isolation of the service-level runtime between services
// and they still share a process-level runtime, but at least there is an advantage in that all
// service-level components are placed in the runtime, so that the configuration and components can be
// easily retrieved from the runtime without having to pass them as parameters, so that when adding
// service-level components in the future, there is no need to modify the parameter list.
