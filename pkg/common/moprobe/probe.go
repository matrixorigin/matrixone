// Poorman's usdt probe.
// Using bpftrace to trace go user space code is hard.  There are a few problems with go runtime
//  1. you simply cannot use uretprobe.  Go runtime may move stack around and return probe simply
//     does not work.
//  2. the argument to uprobe is rather hard to get.  Golang ABI changed so most of the stuff you
//     find on the web is obsolete.
//  3. there are ways of creating usdt with rather sophisticated bpf hacks, but I don't think it
//     can be understood by meer mortal.
//  4. thread id is not meaningful in go.  goroutine id is also fishy and rather hard to get.  Thread
//     id is extremely important/useful for tracing.
//
// Anyway, I didn't find a "satisfying" solution, so let's roll out our own.   It is extremely simple.
// When you need a static tracepoint, simply create a function here in this file.  The function should take
// *AT MOST* 9 arguments, *ALL* of them *int64*.  If you want to pass in a string, then use 2 params, a pointer
// that is converted to int64, and a length (you don't need this one if length is not needed).  The arguments
// are available in bpftrace in registers.  DO NOT pass in complex data structures as arg.  Go will put those
// on stack and it is simply impossible for bpftrace to decode.
//
// We suggest you always use first argument as a tag -- this is roughly the tid of C program.  You use this
// to track function call and return so that you won't mix call/return from different go routines.  A pointer
// of context, or go data structure converted to int64 usually works well.
//
// Not the noinline pragma. We will use bpftrace uprobe -- it can not be probed if the function is inlined.
//
// The following is here for reference.   See latest golang ABI for any changes.
//
// For AMD64, the register for args are
// 	ax, bx, cx, di, si, r8, r9, r10, r11
// Note that bpftrace does not use eax, rax, etc.   It is simply ax.   You can print out with %ld or %lx to get
// the full 8 bytes.
//
// For arm64, the registers are r0 - r15.
